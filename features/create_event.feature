Feature: Create event
  As a user
  So that I can create and post a new event

Background: events in database
  Given the following events exist:
    | title                | host              | event_time              | status | joined | attendee_limit |
    | Enjoy Lunch at Junzi | Daemon Targaryen  | 2022-10-30 00:00:00 UTC | open   | 1      | 2 |

  Given the following users exist:
    | username         | password | email                     |
    | Daemon Targaryen | dt123    | daemontargaryen@gmail.com |

Scenario: the user logout
  Given I logged in as "TestUser"
  When I go to the logout page
  Then I should be on the welcome page

Scenario: the user doesn't exist
  Given I hacked in as "FakeUser"
  When I go to the login page
  And I fill in "username" with "doesnotexist"
  And I fill in "password" with "doesnotexist"
  And I press "Login"
  Then I should be on the login page
  And I should see "User does not exist"

Scenario: the user successfully posts a new event
  Given I logged in as "TestUser"
  When I go to the post event page
  Then I should see "Post New Event"
  When I fill in "Title" with "Test Party Event"
  And I fill in "Maximum Number of Attendees" with "4"
  And I press "Post Event"
  Then I should be on the home page
  And I should see "Test Party Event"

Scenario: the user fails to post a new event because of empty title value
  Given I logged in as "TestUser"
  When I go to the post event page
  Then I should see "Post New Event"
  When I fill in "Maximum Number of Attendees" with "4"
  And I press "Post Event"
  Then I should be on the post event page
  And I should see "Field 'Title' must be correctly filled in."
